Hi gang this game is a html5 canvas game.made with object oriented javascript 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
And i have used webpack to pack all the modules in one single bundle.js
Step 1️⃣:
to install webpack
npm i -g webpack webpack-cli
Step 2️⃣:
webpack ./js/game.js --output-filename=bundle.js --mode=development
You might need to add the environment path with cmd opened with administration
to do so:📪
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm\", "User")
